## Arrays
Arrays are JavaScript's way to making lists. Arrays can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans). like lists, arrays are ordened, meaning each item has a numbered position.

Example of array:

```
let concepts = ['creating arrays', 'array structures', 'array manipulation']
```

## Create an Array
*array literal* is an one way we can create an array. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets `[]`.

Arrays can store any data type, we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types.

`['element example', 10, true]`

We can also save an array to a variable.

```
let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];
```
