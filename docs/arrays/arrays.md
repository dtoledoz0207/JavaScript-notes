## Arrays
Arrays are JavaScript's way to making lists. Arrays can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans). like lists, arrays are ordened, meaning each item has a numbered position.

Example of array:

```
let concepts = ['creating arrays', 'array structures', 'array manipulation']
```
