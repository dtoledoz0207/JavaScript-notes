## Variables
In programming, a variable is a container for a value. You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computerâ€™s memory.

Variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:

  1. Create a variable with descriptive name.
  2. Store or update information stored in a variable.
  3. Reference or "get" information stored in a variable.
