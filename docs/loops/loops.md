# Loops

* [Loops](#Loops)


## Loops
A *Loop* is a programming tool that repeats a set of instructions until a specified condition, called a *stopping condition* is reached.

The generic term *iterate* is used when referring to loops; iterate simply means "to repeat".

Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.

Loops iterate or repeat an action until a specefic condition is met. When the condition is met, the loop stop and the computer moves on to the next part of the program.
