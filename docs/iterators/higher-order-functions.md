## Introduction
In programming, we can accomplish "abstraction" by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs.

We are going to learn about another way to add a level of abstraction to our programming: *higher-order functions.* *Higher-order functions* are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions on other abstractions, just like "We hosted a birthday party" is an abstraction that may build on the abstraction "We made a cake".

## Functions as Data
JavaScript functions behave like any other data type in the language; we can assingn functions to variables, and we can reassign them to new variables.

```js
const announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork = () => {
    console.log("Iâ€™m doing very important work!");
};
```

We can re-assign the function to a variable with a suitably short name:

```js
const busy = announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork;

busy();
```

`busy` is a variable that holds a *reference* to our original function. Our new `busy()` function can be invoked with parentheses as if that was the name we originally gave our function.

Notice how we assign `announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork` without parentheses as the value to the `busy` variable. We want to assign the value of the function itself, not the value it returns when invoked.

In JavaScript, functions are *first class objects*. This means that, like other objects you've encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods. You can see more about the methods and properties of functions [in the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function).

## Functions as Parameters
Sice functions can behave like any other type of data in JavaScript, it might not surprise you to lear that we can also pass functions (into other functions) as parameters.

A *higher-order function* is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, return a function, or both.

We call the functions that get passed in as parameters and invoked *callback* functions because they get called during the execution of the higher-order function.

When we pass a function in as an argument to another function, we don't invoke it. Invoking the function would evaluate to the return value of the that function call. With callbacks, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name *without* the parentheses.

```js
const timeFuncRuntime = funcParameter => {
    let t1 = Date.now();
    funcParameter();
    let t2 = Date.now();
    return t2 - t1;
}

const addOneToOne = () => 1 + 1;

timeFuncRuntime(addOneToOne);
```

We wrote a higher-order fuction, `timeFuncRuntime()`. It takes in a function as an argument, saves a starting time, invokes the callback function, records time after the function was called, and return the time the function took to run by subtracting the starting time from the ending time.
