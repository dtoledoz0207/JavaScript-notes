# Higher-Order Functions

* [Introduction](#Introduction)


## Introduction
In programming, we can accomplish "abstraction" by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs.

We are going to learn about another way to add a level of abstraction to our programming: *higher-order functions.* *Higher-order functions* are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions on other abstractions, just like "We hosted a birthday party" is an abstraction that may build on the abstraction "We made a cake".
